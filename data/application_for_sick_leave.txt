Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to come to work for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell, and after consulting with my doctor, it has been determined that I need to take some time off to rest and recover.

I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, and I will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. In the meantime, if there are any urgent tasks that need to be addressed, please let me know and I will do my best to assist remotely.

Thank you for your understanding. I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return to work.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
